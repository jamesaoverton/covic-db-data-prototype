# CoVIC-DB Tool Prototype

This is a preliminary prototype for working with [IEDB](http://iedb.org)-style data in a git repository. Requirements are GNU Make and Python 3 (see `requirements.txt`).

The tools are in a separate repository: https://github.com/jamesaoverton/covic-db-tool-prototype

A demo is here: https://cvdb.ontodev.com
